# Algorithm using Memoization

This project solves a grid problem that envolves a NxM grid in which a portion can be cut, and the algorithm will find all the possible ways to fill that grid with squares going from 1x1, all the way to the maximum square size that can fit in that grid, using memoization and a recursion algorithm in C++.
